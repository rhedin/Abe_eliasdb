I discovered that the github version of eliasdb and ecal was missing some useful development that was done in the devt.de version. 
I had forked the github versions of eliasdb and ecal from krotik to rhedin. 
So I destroyed those versions and copied new versions from the devt.de website. 
I named the new versions Abe_eliasdb and Abe_ecal, not plain eliasdb and ecal. 
Also, Matthias Ladkau just copied versions he felt were "significant" from devt.de/krotik to github.com/krotik. 
All the steps in between were missing from the github version.
