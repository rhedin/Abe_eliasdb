I discovered that the github.com/krotik version of eliasdb and ecal was missing some useful development that was done in the devt.de/krotik version. 
I had forked the github.com/krotik versions of eliasdb and ecal to github.com/rhedin . 
So I destroyed those github.com/rhedin versions and cloned new versions from devt.de/krotik . 
I named the new versions Abe_eliasdb and Abe_ecal, not plain eliasdb and ecal. 
Also, Matthias Ladkau just copied versions he felt were "significant" from devt.de/krotik to github.com/krotik. 
All the steps in between were missing from the github version. 


Ha!  The scripts (and probably other things) in these directories refer to other directories by name. 
So my cleverly renamed directories (Abe_eliasdb) won't work. 
Luckily, Grok tells me internally git keeps all the references relatively, so I can rename the directories 
with impunity.
