I was wrong.  start.sh wasn't complaining because it couldn't find the eliasdb directory. 
It was complaining because it couldn't find th eliasdb file in the eliasdb directory. 
Have to make eliasdb, before the examples will run.  Duh. 

Good example of the current logging system in eliasdb/server/server.go . 

Shall I use the existing logging system, or the slog system?  For my new stuff? 
Existing.  I would say. 
Does it record where the error occurred? 

In the docker file, in the comments (not in code that is executed), it puts 
krotik/eliasdb for the image argument of the run command.  Documentation 
says you can specify a repository in that position.  That seems to be 
what he is doing. 
     We don't use the docker file.  So we will leave the krotik/eliasdb 
in place.
